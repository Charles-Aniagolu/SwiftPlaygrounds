// Operators and Control Flow



//Arithmetic Operators: such as +, - , *, /, % (modulus)

//Comparison Operators: such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

//Logical Operators: such as &&, ||, !

//Assignment Operators:

/**
 == (assign),
 += (add and assign),
 -= (substract and assign),
 *= (muliplication and assign),
 /= divide and assign,
 %= (modulus and assign).

//Control flow structures such as:
/**
 if statements
   //else
   //else if
   //Switch
 */

//Looping Statements
  /**
   for loop
   while loop
   do-while loop
   */

//Branching
 /**
  break
  continue
  return
  */
